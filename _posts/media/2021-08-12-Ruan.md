**Condensation formed in post-flare loop**
*Author: [Wenzhi Ruan]({{ site.url }}/team/wenzhiruan)*


In the simulations of Prominence formation and active region coronal rain formation, extra heating is often needed to compensate the radiative loss inside the coronal loop. We aim to check that whether the heating is necessary for the happening of condensation inside the flare loop. Therefore, a simulation of flare loop cooling has been done. Here we show the results.

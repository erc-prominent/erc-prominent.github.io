    <p class="post-excerpt">
    We envision realistic, 3D models of prominences, simulated far into the turbulent regime and plan to make direct
    contact with modern turbulence studies. We are working on coronal rain simulations at extreme resolutions, and are
    investigating the intricacies of linear waves in plasmas and how these connect to prominence dynamics.

	  <p class="post-excerpt">
    Our grid-adaptive, massively parallel software <a href="amrvac.org">MPI-AMRVAC</a> allows us to identify and predict
    detailed solar prominence and coronal rain aspects at extreme resolutions. These are supplemented with MHD linear
    eigenspectrum studies using <a href="legolas.science">Legolas</a>, our new, modern linear MHD solver.

    <p class="post-excerpt">
    A dedicated team effort embedded within the
    <a href="https://wis.kuleuven.be/CmPA">Centre for mathematical Plasma-Astrophysics</a> at KU Leuven
    and led by prof. Rony Keppens sets forth to guide, interpret and confront solar prominence activity.

    <p class="post-excerpt">
      How, where and why does the million degree solar corona spontaneously form these gigantic structures?
      What causes finestructure throughout the prominence body? How do they relate to coronal rain?
      What is the role of solar tornadoes often found at their feet?

As a PhD student on the ERC PROMINENT project, I have devoted my time to the study of waves and instabilities in MHD and two-fluid descriptions. An analytical study of waves in an ideal, warm two-fluid description was carried out for a homogeneous background at rest, focusing on the dispersion relation and the phase and group speeds of all six wave types. To investigate more complex setups, we turn to the spectral analysis of the linearised MHD equations using the

code.

Ongoing work focuses on the implementation and testing of viscosity and Hall extensions of the

code for 1D MHD spectroscopy.

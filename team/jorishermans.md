During my PhD as part of the ERC PROMINENT project, I have been working on:

-A case study of the effect of optically thin radiative cooling curves on condensation formation by thermal instability

The first animation shows the nonlinear evolution of thermal instability for solar coronal conditions. A small density fix is used to ensure a feasible time step due to the restriction by the CFL condition. It shows the fragmentation and redistribution of the filamentary condensation. The second animation shows the evolution of a hydrodynamic version of the simulation. Two sound waves are being damped. Thermal instability creates a condensation that shatters.
For details see Hermans J. & Keppens R., 2021, Submitted to A&A. More will be explained once accepted.

A paper now accepted by A&A (see [^1] or [^2]) accompanies the recent (November 2022) release 3.0 of the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code[^3]. The paper showcases the code flexibility on a variety of hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) tests, and  documents new modules of direct interest for state-of-the-art solar physics applications. We demonstrate the use of super-time-stepping strategies for specific parabolic terms and give details on all the implemented implicit-explicit integrators. Synthetic observations of 3D MHD simulations can now be rendered on the fly, in many spectral wavebands. Our open-source strategy welcomes any further code usage, contribution, or spin-off development.

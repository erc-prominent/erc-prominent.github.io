Contribution to  [MPI-AMRVAC](http://amrvac.org) development

a) Implementation  of partial ionization effects through:

- Ambipolar term in the induction equation in the MHD approximation. The ambipolar term is implemented using the supertimestepping technique.

- Two-fluid (charges and neutrals) equations. The collisional terms are implemented implicitly in a semi-implicit scheme.

b) Splitting of the density and pressure variables into time-independent and time-dependent parts

Application of the code to the study of: 

- wave propagation 

- instabilities (work in progress)

**Prominence formation by levitation-condensation at extreme resolutions**
*Author: [Jack Jenkins]({{ site.url }}/team/jackjenkins)*

The first step in creating a full 3D prominence formation and condensation model with MPI-AMRVAC was successfully completed in Jenkins & Keppens (2020) with a 2.5D translationally-invariant setup. This study revealed a range of dynamics and instabilities at work during the onset of condensation formation within a prominence - the specifics of which can be read in detail [here](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2021/02/aa39630-20.pdf). A selection of the movies that accompanied that paper are reproduced here.

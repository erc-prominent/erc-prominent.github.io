As of January 2020 I've been a PhD student working as part of the ERC PROMINENT team. My research work is on the topic of prominence oscillations. 

Solar prominence are cold and dense plasma formations, located in a much hotter and tenuous solar corona. Why the corona gets hotter the further we are from the Sun's surface (source of the heat) has been one of the longest mysteries linked to the Sun's mechanisms. Prominence oscillation are an important part of the solar atmosphere and can greatly help us unravel the mystery of the Sun's atmosphere.

The main goal of my research is to understand the oscillatory dynamics of prominences in greater detail. I use an open source MHD simulation code, [MPI-AMRVAC](http://amrvac.org) to study a multi-threaded 2D prominence in order to better understand the interactions and behaviour of threads during different types of oscillations.

A unique observation (and a simple 2.5D MHD model of fast wave propagation) proved the existence of MHD wave lensing in the corona. A coronal hole transmits the wave front from a flare, and its shape and density contrast cause the transmitted waves on the opposing side to focus in a precise location.

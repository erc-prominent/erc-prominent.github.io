**Condensation formed in post-flare loop**
*Author: [Wenzhi Ruan]({{ site.url }}/team/wenzhiruan)*


In the simulations of Prominence formation and active region coronal rain formation, extra heating is often needed to compensate the radiative loss inside the coronal loop. We aim to check that whether the heating is necessary for the happening of condensation inside the flare loop. Therefore, a simulation of flare loop cooling has been done. Here we show the results.


There is a current sheet inside the simulation box at the initial condition, which allow the happening of magnetic reconnection. Flare loop is formed due to the reconnection. The formation and cooling of the flare loop is simulated. A backgroud heating is adopted for the region outside the flare loop to compensate the coronal energy loss owing to thermal conduction and radiative cooling, while the backgroud heating inside the flare loop is set to zero. The following movies demonstrate the evolution of density, temperature. A movie of background heating is also provided. We can see that condesation can happen inside flare loop even though there is no heating insdie the loop.
